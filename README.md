## Motivation

Planning outings/get-togethers with a group of people is often a challenging task as **finding common free time** among so many people may be a **drawn-out process** due to slow replies when checking availability and **clashes in everyone’s busy schedules.** 

Furthermore, as it is possible that there is **no common time slot** in which everyone will be free at the same time, **deciding on the next best meeting time will be a chore due to the varying priorities in each individual’s schedules.**

Besides the aforementioned problem, **not everyone is able to prioritise their work properly**, which leads to poor time management. Work life balance is then often comprised, resulting in **time with friends and family being sacrificed.** 

## Aim
To provide a platform that helps users 
* better plan their schedules, 
* make the processing of finding common free time among a group of people efficient and convenient, and 
* improve users’ social life by creating more opportunities for friends and family to spend time together.

## Features

### Calendar
In-app calendar where users can save and edit their schedule into.
Users can set a priority level for each event in their calendar: Low, Medium or High.

### Synchronization 
Users are able to synchronize their timetable with other users to find common free time. 
The user must specify the start and end dates of their calendars to sync and the amount of free time needed. With varying priority levels, free time slots are sorted according to empty slots first, then by clashing priority levels.

### Open Jio 
Users will be able to post any of their activities of their choice as an open invitation to friends to join them in that particular activity. 
Likewise, the user will be able to view a feed of posted invitations (“jios”) from all friends in their friend list.

### Other Minor Features
* Device-to-device notifications
* Update User display name and profile picture
* Email Verification
* Reset Password
